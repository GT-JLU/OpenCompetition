# OpenComptition Toolkit
## Overview

This is a collection of commonly used algorithms and tricks from data science compotitions, as well
as ideas for researches. This repository covers algorithms for tabular data mining, NLP,
CV and RL. 

## Prerequisite
### Foundations
The basic program is based on Anaconda 3.7.

### Deep Learning Framework
This repository is currently based on two deep learning frameworks:

1. TensorFlow 1.13.
2. PyTorch 1.14.

The reason why we have not yet chosen the newer version of TensorFlow is because 
it is not yet stable, especially in the sense that the API seems to have been undergoing 
dramatic revisions. 

### Dependencies
There are a few dependencies for this library, this can be installed using the following command.

1. Install AllenNLP toolkit by `pip install allennlp`.
2. Install Huggingface Transformers by `pip install transformers`.
