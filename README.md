# Open Competition Tookkit
A collection of algorithms for data science competition. We will only focus developing (and copying) the latest progress. 

## Current Goals (Under Construction)
### Tabular
1. NN based methods
2. Auto Tabular

### NLP
1. Classification. 
2. Sequence Labeling
3. Relationship Extraction
4. Summarization
5. AutoNLP

### CV
1. Classification
2. Object Detection

### Reinforcement Learning
1. V-trace 
2. Improved MCTS

## Character
1. Code related to algorithms are mostly writen in python and R. Performance critical ones are written in C++ (linked to Python using Cython).
2. Code will be written in Tensorflow 1.13 and Tensorflow 2.0. The reasons to involve two framework is that currently TPU only supports 1.13. 
3. An example will be offered on how to deploy models using TensorflowServer, Kubernetes and Istio. 
4. We encourage users to record their experience in the demo file. We will also actively collect such resource. 
5. Other useful resources will be listed in the Resource.md.
6. If needed, one can contact ran.wang.math@gmail.com for Google Cloud testing.

## Now to Contribute
1. Anyone can contribute. However, do not contribute codes that are meant to be kept private. 
2. Please only English to communicate. 
3. Every once for a while, a bounty will be put for the implementation of certain features. Please refer to the Bounty.md for information.
4. If a feature is desirable, one can email ran.wang.math@gmail.com for the possibility of implementation.
