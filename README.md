# The Open Competition Toolkit 

## Overview
This is a library that collects the useful codes for data science competition, as well as some code for research purposes. 

The library contains materials for Tabular Data Mining, NLP, CV and RL. 

Most of the code are written in Python 3.7, except some part of Cython, C++ and R. We do, however, provide an unified interface for python.

Some reference for what will be implemented can be found here https://www.overleaf.com/read/xftrzgtcxkpd (registration needed). I will be hosting the details on the lecture on GeekBang (https://time.geekbang.org/).
